# Console Application Project

## Overview
This project is a C# console application that allows users to choose between three different programs:

1. **Random Number Guessing Game**
2. **Calculator**
3. **Grade Average Calculator**

Each program is implemented as a separate method in the code and can be accessed via a simple main menu.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in an IDE that supports C#, such as Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a program and interact with it.

## Project Features
### 1. Random Number Guessing Game
- The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user has 5 attempts to guess the number, receiving hints whether the guess is too high or too low.
- If the user guesses correctly, they are congratulated. If all attempts are used, the correct number is shown.

### 2. Calculator
- The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- The program performs the calculation and displays the result.
- Division by zero is handled with an appropriate error message.

### 3. Grade Average Calculator
- The user inputs three exam grades.
- The program calculates the average and displays the corresponding letter grade.
- The grade scale is based on a range from 0-100, and invalid grades outside this range are rejected.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET Core** or **.NET Framework**
- **Visual Studio** (for development)

## Additional Information
This project is intended for beginners to practice basic C# concepts such as:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Input validation
- Random number generation
- Arithmetic operations
